# Edge_Prediction_ML
I construct features and create machine learning models for edge prediction. 

# A Brief Description of the files

1. Enron_Edge_Prediction.ipynb: Jupiter notebook for constructing edge prediction models based on the features created in Enron_Feature_Construction.ipynb. 

2. Enron_Feature_Construction.ipynb: Jupiter notebook for constructing features for edge and non-edge pairs for the Enron email network.

3. Enron_Network_Extraction.ipynb: Borrowed code for extracting the Enron email network out of the lists of files.

4. Facebook_Edge_Prediction_Ind.ipynb: Juptier notebook for constructing edge prediction models based on the features created in Facebook_Feature_Generator.ipynb. Note that this notebook fits a model to each of the facebook networks individually.

5. Facebook_Edge_Prediction_Pool.ipynb: Jupiter notebook for constructing edge prediction models based on the features created in Facebook_Feature_Generator.ipynb. Note that this notebook fits one single model to the edges from all of the facebook networks.

6. Facebook_Feature_Generator.ipynb: Jupiter notebook for constructing features for edge and non-edge pairs for the facebook100 social networks.

7. Facebook_Feature_Single_Model.ipynb: Jupiter notebook for constructing features for edge and non-edge pairs for a specified network of the facebook100.

8. hepPH_Edge_Prediction.ipynb: Jupiter notebook for constructing edge prediction models based on the features created in hepPH_Feature_Construction.ipynb. 

9. hepPH_Feature_Construction.ipynb: Jupiter notebook for constructing features for edge and non-edge pairs for the hepPH citation network.
